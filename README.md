****This project consists of a basic Bank Management System for staff and customer account management. 
The code file is named BMS_code.c, and the executable file is BMS_code.exe. Staff can log in, create 
new staff IDs, create customer accounts, perform deposit and withdrawal transactions, and list out all of the customers account and balance. 
To compile the code, use gcc BMS_code.c -o BMS_app.exe, and run the executable to start the system. 
The program uses staff.txt and customers.txt to store staff credentials and customer data, respectively.
NOTE: THIS IS SECOND VERSION OF MY BMS PROJECT, I DID THIS BECAUSE I FELT THAT MY FIRST VERSION WAS MORE LIKE A MOBILE BANKING SOFTWARE
Updated NOTE: I have learn much after creating this repo and now I see how dumb I was to create a version 2 of the same project in a new repo while the whole point of the github is version control.Laugh at me lolðŸ˜‚****
